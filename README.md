# ForgeForce
## Overview
A fully on-chain card game that introduces a unique cooperative battle mechanic. Instead of players directly competing against each other, they collectively fight a public monster. This monster represents a prize pool, which is funded by various sources including card pack sales and trading fees from a dedicated NFT marketplace.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Attack Styles** : Players can choose their desired attack style. Based on their chosen style, the return and risk can vary.
- **Card NFTs**: Unique, collectible cards with varying attributes and features that players can trade or use in battles.
- **Dynamic Prize Pool**: Funded by card pack sales and marketplace transaction fees, ensuring continuous growth. 
- **Fully On-Chain**: All game mechanics, including card attributes, damage calculations, and prize distributions, are managed by smart contracts, ensuring transparency and fairness.

## Planning
This project is started for attending **Battle of Olympus Program**, hosted by **Movement**. While we are ambitious about completing our vision for the project, our top priority during the program is to build a solid foundation for the future.

Hence, in **Battle of Olympus Program**, we will mainly focus on building the fundamental features, including:

- Designing an appropriate game economy, which is crucial for our project's future.
- Designing the core card utilities, carefully balanced with the overall game structure.
- Implementing the basic functions of the game, such as basic attack actions and basic monster generation events.
- Implementing a basic frontend website to demonstrate the entire process.
